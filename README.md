ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the ELCI-Linux github page. 

During our migration from Windows to Linux, we found installing software was often consuming more time than actually performing the tasks the software was required for. Obscure repositories, varying installation methods and poorly written build instructions make installing software far to difficult for many users. Our helpers are designed to simplify installationby removing the need for the end user to have prior experience, met dependencies or research into how to install a specific program.
