üëã Hi, ELCI-Linux is an open source project aimed at creating a forked Linux distro for home use and deployment in small-to-medium sized business.
During the course of development, elements of the project will be published publicly for open collaboation and feed back.


As of August 2021, the framework for the general software installer is public.
Alphav1 features a combination of scripts designed to install and/or run various applications on debian based systems.
The alpha program
Alpha is a great tool for first time Linux users. 
Alpha includes ELCI software installer (with over 100 applications) 
Alpha gives you access to Tubi, an experimental YouTube-dl frontend. 


You can use Alphav2 by typing the command below into your terminal

    $ git clone https://www.github.com/ELCI-Linux/alphav2
    $ cd /alphav2

From here you can use any of individual install/run scripts

For example, to use the ELCI software installer type
the command below into your terminal:

    $ bash elci.sh



You can then follow the prompts on screen 
to execute over 100 automated software installs.

EmulatorsX installs a variety of Nintendo and Sony Platform Emulators

To run EmulatorsX, type in the following command:

        $ bash EmulatorsX.sh
      
 

Installs are grouped in categories. 


Mobile support tools:
  - These tools allow users to quickly install adb and scrcpy. 
  - iOS support is coming in Alphav1


Music Applications:
  - Audacious + Byte + Celementine + Gnome Music Plater  : Open source audio players.
  Audacious plays music without stealing away your computer‚Äôs resources from other tasks.

  - Hydrogen: An open source drum machine.
  - Spotify: The official Spotify client for Linux
