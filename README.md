ðŸ‘‹ Hi, ELCI-Linux is an open source project aimed at creating a forked Linux distro for home use and deployment in small-to-medium sized business.
During the course of development, elements of the project will be published publicly for open collaboation and feed back.

elci.sh is our first project release. Over 20 different software categories ranging from calculators and web browsers, to DAWs and video editing can be installed using the elci.sh script and the accompanying scripts.

To use the entire elci.sh project, enter the following into your terminal

    git clone https://github.com/ELCI-Linux/elci.sh
    cd ./elci.sh
    bash elci.sh
